This is a template for your app's documentation (we hope your app has [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com/) support built in â€” it really should). Collaborative writing and constant updates have to be well supported when it comes to maintaining technical documentation.

We chose [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to get the job done. If you have never heard of Jekyll or SASS don't worry, it's very easy to get up and running. Should you be unfamiliar with Git this might not be the right thing for you.

##Writing content

Documentation consists of separate Markdown files placed inside `_posts`. You might want to take a look at a our examples. All posts are categorized and available from the sidebar.

The available categories can be found in `_layouts/master.html`. It's as simple as adding another item to that list to create a new category. To assign a post to a specific category just include it in the post's configuration.

This is what the typical configuration for a post looks like:

    ---
    layout: master
    title: Document Title
    categories: category_one category_two
    ---

We think keeping your documentation in plain text files is awesome:

- You can use your favorite [TextEditor](http://macromates.org/) to write posts.
- The generated markup is concise thanks to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
- Collaboration with your team is easy and versioning is built right in.
- You can use your precious time writing posts instead of fiddling with a database.

##Deploying

Deploying is extremely easy.
